  segmdfr,
  name = "cell",
  calc_centroids = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{segmdfr}{data.frame-like object with polygon coordinate information (x, y, poly_ID)
with x and y being vertex information for the polygon referenced by poly_ID. See details
for how columns are selected for coordinate and ID information.}

\item{name}{name for the \code{giottoPolygon} object}

\item{calc_centroids}{(default FALSE) calculate centroids for polygons}

\item{verbose}{be verbose}

\item{skip_eval_dfr}{(default FALSE) skip evaluation of provided dataframe}

\item{copy_dt}{(default TRUE) if segmdfr is provided as dt, this determines
whether a copy is made}
}
\value{
giotto polygon object
}
\description{
Creates Giotto polygon object from a structured dataframe-like object.
Three of the columns should correspond to x/y vertices and the polygon ID.
Additional columns are set as attributes
}
\details{
When determining which column within the tabular data is intended to
provide polygon information, Giotto first checks the column names for 'x', 'y',
and 'poly_ID'. If any of these are discovered, they are directly selected. If
this is not discovered then Giotto checks the data type of the columns and selects
the first `'character'` type column to be 'poly_ID' and the first two `'numeric'`
columns as 'x' and 'y' respectively. If this is also unsuccessful then poly_ID
defaults to the 3rd column. 'x' and 'y' then default to the 1st and 2nd columns.
