\usage{
getBalancedSpatCoexpressionFeats(
  spatCorObject,
  maximum = 50,
  rank = c("weighted", "random", "informed"),
  informed_ranking = NULL,
  seed = NA,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatCorObject}{spatial correlation object}

\item{maximum}{maximum number of genes to get from each spatial co-expression module}

\item{rank}{ranking method (see details)}

\item{informed_ranking}{vector of ranked features}

\item{seed}{seed}

\item{verbose}{verbosity}
}
\value{
balanced vector with features for each co-expression module
}
\description{
Extract features from spatial co-expression modules in a balanced manner
}
\details{
There are 3 different ways of selectig features from the spatial
co-expression modules
\itemize{
  \item{1. weighted: }{Features are ranked based on summarized pairwise co-expression scores}
  \item{2. random: }{A random selection of features, set seed for reproducibility}
  \item{3. informed: }{Features are selected based on prior information/ranking}
}
}
